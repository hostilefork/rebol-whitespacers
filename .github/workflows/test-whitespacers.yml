  #====# CHECKOUT STEPS #=====================================================#


    # GitHub CI checkout on Windows auto translates LF to CR/LF in files:
    #
    # https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/135
    #
    # However, Ren-C is taking the long view on this and prohibiting CR/LF in
    # source by default.

  #====# REN-C VERSION TEST STEPS #===========================================#

    # Ren-C is an aggressively redesigned version of the open-source Rebol
    # R3-Alpha code.  The whitespace script that runs on Ren-C establishes a
    # sort of "domain specific language" for writing "Whitespace-like"
    # interpreters.
    #
    # If the interpreter FAILs due to an internal error it will return an exit
    # code of 1, and 0 returned on success.  But we also want to check the
    # output matches what was expected.  To do that in a cross-platform way,
    # use Ren-C CALL to invoke a Ren-C subprocess to run the interpreter,
    # save the output to a string, and compare to a known result.

  #====# "REDBOL" VERSION TEST STEPS #========================================#

    # The original Rebol version written circa 2010 ran in the pre-open-source
    # "R3-Alpha" interpreter.  That less interesting version still runs today
    # relatively unchanged under emulation via "Redbol", and is kept around as
    # a test of that emulation.
